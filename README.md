# Fnp_Sales_Analysis


“FNP Sales Analysis is a data-driven project built on the Ferns N Petals gifting dataset, focusing on uncovering key trends in revenue, customer spending, product performance, and seasonal demand across major occasions like Valentine’s Day, Raksha Bandhan, and Diwali. Using tools like Excel/Power BI, the analysis tracks KPIs such as total revenue, average order value, top-performing products, and high-contributing cities, helping identify when and where sales peak and how delivery performance relates to order volume. These insights can support decisions in pricing, inventory planning, marketing campaigns, and customer experience optimization for FNP’s online gifting business.”​
